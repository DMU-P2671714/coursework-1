<p class="aboutp1">Prison drama. Tom Hanks stars in director Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novel (the second King novel Darabont and Hanks brought to the big screen, after The Shawshank Redemption). In 1935, in a Louisiana prison, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) is head guard on the death row, which is known locally as the green mile. He's a kind man who aims to make life as easy as possible for himself, his colleagues and the condemned prisoners. But when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) - a man-mountain with learning disabilities who has been convicted of raping and murdering two girls - arrives things start to get strange. Coffey banishes Hanks' urinary infection with a touch, brings a dead pet mouse back to life and cures the chief warden's wife's cancer. His healing abilities and gentleness make the prison staff question his guilt. But can anything prevent Coffey's appointment with the execution chamber?</p>

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support the video format.
<!-- i added the trailer by using the 'video' code then added 'controls' so that hte website user has the ability to control it. I added an image to the 'autoplay poster' to be able to show the a still of the movie instead of the first frame of the video. -->
<!--the text below the 'video' element will show if the video format isnt available for the user instead of it just being a blank space-->
<!--having ddifferent video format makes sure that if a browser doestn support one format then there is another one that it migth be able to support, making it more accessable to more users-->
